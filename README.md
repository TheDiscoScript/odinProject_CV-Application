# Welcome to CV-App project! üëã

### üè† [Homepage](http://Willdooo.github.io/odinProject_CV-Application)

### Description

This is the first proejct I made in React. I haven''t used React Hooks, only React classes.
It is fairly simple project as there is not too much logic in it.
Still it took me a while because I wasn't really comfortable with React at first. I also used Material-UI as React framework.
Project made as part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application).
